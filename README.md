# Farm of Rot
"Plant, Grow, Rot, Repeat"<br>
A game which is a mix of a farming simulator, and a tower defence.

## Features
* Farming
	* Grow and water a variety of seeds, which grow into plants (defensive towers).
	* Plants rot over time, turning them into enemies, and drop even more powerful seeds upon death.
* Tower Defense
	* Defend your farm against a daily whore of rotten vegetables using various towers.
	* Expand your farm at the end of every week, allowing you to grow a bigger farm, while also making the waves harder.
	* Enemies drop seeds that are used to plant towers.
